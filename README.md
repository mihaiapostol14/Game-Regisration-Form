## Features

- **Clean Registration Interface:**  
  The form collects:
  - Player Username
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email Address
  - Password

- **Input Validation:**  
  All fields include client-side validation (e.g., required fields, minimum/maximum lengths, valid email format, and password requirements).

- **Modern, Stylish Design:**  
  Uses a custom CSS theme with a dark background, accent colors, and the 'Zen Dots' Google font for a visually appealing, game-inspired look.

- **Responsive Layout:**  
  The form is centered and adapts well for desktop displays.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - HTML in `html/index.html`  
  - Styling in `css/style.css`  
  - JavaScript logic in `js/script.js`
